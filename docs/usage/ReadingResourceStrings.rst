Reading Resource Strings
###########################################################

The following `document <http://www.skynet.ie/~caolan/publink/winresdump/winresdump/doc/resfmt.txt>`__ has some useful notes on how resource strings are stored within the resources section in a PE file. Quoting directly from the document:

.. code-block:: python

 4.8 String Table Resources 
 
    These tables are constructed in blocks of 16 strings.  The 
    organization of these blocks of 16 is determined by the IDs given to 
    the various strings.  The lowest four bits of the ID determine a 
    string s position in the block.  The upper twelve bits determine 
    which block the string is in.  Each block of 16 strings is stored as 
    one resource entry.  Each string or error table resource block is 
    stored as follows: 
    
        [Normal resource header (type = 6 for strings)] 
        
        [Block of 16 strings.  The strings are Pascal style with a WORD 
        length preceding the string.  16 strings are always written, even 
        if not all slots are full.  Any slots in the block with no string 
        have a zero WORD for the length.] 
        
    It is important to note that the various blocks need not be written 
    out in numerical order in the resource file.  Each block is assigned 
    an ordinal ID.  This ID is the high 12 bits of the string IDs in the 
    block plus one (ordinal IDs can t be zero).  The blocks are written 
    to the .RES file in the order the blocks are encountered in the .RC 
    file, while the CVTRES utility will cause them to become ordered in 
    the COFF object, and hence the image file.

===========================================================

Hence, to extract those string from the file, we can write a small Python script using *pefile*.

First we need to read the directory entry for the resources and see if there's an entry of type ``RT_STRING`` (value 6).

.. code-block:: python

    print [entry.id for entry in pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE.entries]

Would produce something like ``(3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 14, 24)``. Therefore we know that in this specific PE file the ``RT_STRING`` directory entry is at index 3.

A dump of the corresponding resource directory entry looks like:

.. code-block:: python

      Id: [0x6] (RT_STRING)
      [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY]
      Name:                          0x6       
      OffsetToData:                  0x80000108
        [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY]
        Characteristics:               0x0       
        TimeDateStamp:                 0x0        [Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970 UTC]
        MajorVersion:                  0x0       
        MinorVersion:                  0x0       
        NumberOfNamedEntries:          0x0       
        NumberOfIdEntries:             0x1       
          Id: [0x7]
          [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY]
          Name:                          0x7       
          OffsetToData:                  0x80000320
            [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY]
            Characteristics:               0x0       
            TimeDateStamp:                 0x0        [Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970 UTC]
            MajorVersion:                  0x0       
            MinorVersion:                  0x0       
            NumberOfNamedEntries:          0x0       
            NumberOfIdEntries:             0x1       
              [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY]
              Name:                          0x409     
              OffsetToData:                  0x4B8     
                [IMAGE_RESOURCE_DATA_ENTRY]
                OffsetToData:                  0x251F0
                Size:                          0x48
                CodePage:                      0x0
                Reserved:                      0x0


We need to iterate through all the directory entries under the RT\_STRING directory and read the data entries in order to be able to reach the actual string data.

We can iterate through the entries with the following code:

(the strings will be saved in the ``strings`` list)

.. code-block:: python

    # The List will contain all the extracted Unicode strings
    strings = list()

    # Fetch the index of the resource directory entry containing the strings
    rt_string_idx = [
      entry.id for entry in 
      pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE.entries].index(pefile.RESOURCE_TYPE['RT_STRING'])

    # Get the directory entry
    rt_string_directory = pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE.entries[rt_string_idx]

    # For each of the entries (which will each contain a block of 16 strings)
    for entry in rt_string_directory.directory.entries:

      # Get the RVA of the string data and
      # size of the string data
      data_rva = entry.directory.entries[0].data.struct.OffsetToData
      size = entry.directory.entries[0].data.struct.Size
      print 'Directory entry at RVA', hex(data_rva), 'of size', hex(size)

      # Retrieve the actual data and start processing the strings
      data = pe.get_memory_mapped_image()[data_rva:data_rva+size]
      offset = 0
      while True:
        # Exit once there's no more data to read
        if offset>=size:
          break
        # Fetch the length of the unicode string
        ustr_length = pe.get_word_from_data(data[offset:offset+2], 0)
        offset += 2

        # If the string is empty, skip it
        if ustr_length==0:
          continue

        # Get the Unicode string
        ustr = pe.get_string_u_at_rva(data_rva+offset, max_length=ustr_length)
        offset += ustr_length*2
        strings.append(ustr)
        print 'String of length', ustr_length, 'at offset', offset
